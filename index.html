    <p id="web-security-question">
      How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web
      security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be
      greater than 250 words
    </p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">
      Use HTTPS connection everywhere, and a secure FTP for uploading or editing
      any website files. Create strong passwords and and use multi - factor -
      authentication, I would suggest that they use password hashing method to
      convert their password to a string of random and secure characters. They
      should also have multiple accounts with multiple permissions, so that if
      one account is hacked the permissions are limited. Get also rid of old
      accounts. When it comes to emails, they should have secure emails with
      spam filters installed. The database should be encrypted and they should
      keep all of their software updated to avoid any chance of security holes.
      And also they should use a mailware and avoid opening link that they are
      unsure about.
